# init.vim
My vim/neovim config file. Trying to keep it as simple as possible, so should be portable between the two.

## Usage:
You should do `source <filename.vim>` for each of the configuration files you need.
minimal.vim: Only most barebones config, no plugins or gui
plugins.vim: load this to add some useful plugins
gui.vim: load this if you are in gui mode (e.g. in ~/.gvimrc)
